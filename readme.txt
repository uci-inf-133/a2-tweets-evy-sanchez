1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10 (possibly an 11????)
- 3/3 Summarizing tweets
    I did in fact write out the dates of the earliest and latest tweet where they belonged as desired the long way.
    I believe that I was able to summarize the tweets as described in the write up and my percentages about the 
    different categories were within 5% of the ones specified in the write up. Same thing for the written tweets, I
    was within 5% percent of 25%.
- 4/4 Identifying the most popular activities
    I determined the activity types and their distances if they had one. I did not generalize though, each activity
    type, no matter if a subclass was classified as its own kind of activity. And I only did this for completed tweets.
    I also converted any km to miles using the approximation number in the write up (1.609).
    After that I was able to graph the data that I acquired and my second one looks pretty close to the one in the example.
    I hardcoded the tendencies about distances and days based on those graphs.
- 3/3 Adding a text earch interface
    I update the searchCount and searchText spans as the researcher types in the search box. I do not count empty space
    for a search. As they type, the screen changes as well with the response to what they typed in. I assumed I would only 
    be searching the written text from written tweets because that was when my numbers were closest to the example in the write-up.
- 1/1 Bonus Feauture: 
    I did not make two Vega graphs, I edited the 'aggregate' feature in and out of the one I made when the
    aggregate button was clicked. However, I did not do this with Vega streaming data or interactive charts because I would've
    had to add in my own buttons and therefore edit out the aggregate button from the HTML which is prohibited. I did not want
    to leave the button there useless so I found a different way instead with JavaScript. That's why I am unsure if I'd really deserve
    this point.

2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list sites like StackOverflow or specific URLs for tutorials; describe queries to Generative AI or use of AI-based code completion)
    - W3Schools for Javascript Documentation: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_sort.asp
    - Mozilla for JS Documentation and examples: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/

    - Typescript Documentation https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html
    - The Vega-Lite Documentation https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/size.html I didn't use this well but it was still something I looked at and might've applied to my work.
    - The Vega Editor https://vega.github.io/editor/#/edited
    - Chat GPT for debugging: https://chatgpt.com
        I asked questions like:
        - why won't my typescript file load into my js file?
        - why is my function printing nothing (insert my code)?
        - how can I sort an object by numerical values in js?
        - why is my variable empty when I print it to the console?
        - how efficient is the filter() method in js?
        - why is my function so slow??
        - what is wrong with my Vega-Lite coding (insert my code)?
        - what are some ways to make an interactive chart in Vega-Lite?
        - how could I make it so that the chart responds to my button in html rather than making some with vega?
    - Google search
       I asked questions about syntax in typescript and javascript.


4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
    I talked to my friend Elijah about the project but we did not help each other, we were just talking about it. He said that
    he was crashing out about the percentages because he didn't know he didn't have to get them perfect. I said that I was crashing
    out about the graphs for the same reason.


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
    N/A
